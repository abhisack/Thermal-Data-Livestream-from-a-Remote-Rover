# Thermal-Data-Livestream-from-a-Remote-Rover
This is the full code (backend + microcontroller code) of one of the college projects I worked on. The aim of the project was to read the thermal data from a prototype rover and stream it live to a back-end computer via bluetooth.

##Main Components-
1. Arduino Uno Micro-controller
2. SparkFun MLX90614 Thermal Sensor
3. HC05 Bluetooth Module
4. 'serial.io' module to handle serial communication of data via bluetooth
